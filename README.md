A collection of sixteen pride flags represented as very happy ghosts.

## A commissioned work

The initial sixteen ghost emoji were commissioned by an anonymous donator. We thank them for their gracious donation and for supporting the LGBTQ+ community as well as a queer artist. Because this is an LGBTQ+ project, half of the sales price was donated to an LGBTQ+ related good cause.
